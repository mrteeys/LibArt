Hi everyone! 

My name is Yuhang Zhang. This is a library management system. Thank you for your time! 

We use html and css to design front-ends. We use php as main programming language to connect front-end to back-end and use Mysql to design database. Together with all the .php files, we used pickle, another library of Python, to store our encrypted username and password. All the files of our project are shown in the picture below.
